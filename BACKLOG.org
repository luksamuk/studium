This is a backlog of the core features of Studium. I use this file to keep a
relation of stuff I need to do. Pull requests modifying this file are also
accepted, but discussion is prone to happen before they are merged.

The major topics are not disposed in any particular order, however it would
be interesting that subtopics are kept in descending order of importance or
urgency.

* Rendering

* Math

* Entity System

* Audio

* Asset Management

* Scripting
- Find or create a reliable, lightweight scripting language based on Scheme. The
  less the overhead and the library size, the better.
