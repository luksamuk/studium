This is a backlog of the core features of Studium. I use this file to keep a
relation of stuff I need to do. Pull requests modifying this file are also
accepted, but discussion is prone to happen before they are merged.

The major topics are not disposed in any particular order, however it would
be interesting that subtopics are kept in descending order of importance or
urgency.

* Rendering
- Use statically-linked GLFW, and OpenGL 3.3+.
- 2D graphics should be the primary goal.

* Math
- Implement basic math. Correctness should come before optimization.

* Entity System
- Use preferred script language to interface with entities.

* Audio
- Preferably use OGG.
- Use customizable looping sections.
- Recover playback metadata from specialized scripts.

* Asset Management
- Scriptable asset loading, from scripting language.

* Scripting
- Use Janet language for scripting.
